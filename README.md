#`Doctor Booking System (Healthy-Afya App)`
## SEPA Program Sprint Two

# Problem Definition
From time to time, patients usually require specialized treatment in cities such as
Nairobi. You can either visit the doctor's office to get an appointment or make a phone
call. We want to simplify the process by allowing patients to see a list of doctors in a
certain city and book an appointment with them.
I want to building a web application called Healthy-Afya . The
admin should be able to create user accounts for doctors and then doctors can login
and create their schedule. A patient first needs to create a user account before being
able to book a doctor. You can also explore options for doctors to create their own
accounts but these accounts should be verified by the admin first before they appear
for patients to book.
So there are 3 user levels, administrator, doctor and patient. When a patient books an
appointment with a certain specialist, they get an automated email. When a doctor logs
into the system, they should see a list of patients that have booked their services and
the appointment times

## About Healthy-Afya
Healthy Afya is A Doctor Management System
This program is developed  using Django framework.
It is a multi user application .
The three Users in this system are:
 - Admin
 - Patient
 - Doctor

 A Patient creates their accounts and logs  in to the system. Once logged in , a patient can View appointments, book an appointment and apply to be a doctor. If a patient applies to be a doctor, their request is not immediately approved.
 A doctor has to register as a Patient then apply to be a doctor or have their accounts created by an admin. A doctor views appointments; approves, accepts or rejects them. A doctor can also create their schedule.
